# Modern Backend in Python Assignment üå¶Ô∏è

Congrats! You deiced to take the challenge and take another step in your programming career. In this repository, you will find an assignment for the course.

## Assignment

Your task is to implement `weather.py` - a small CLI tool that prints the current temperature of a city.

## Instructions

Fork this repository **as a private repo** and implement the code in the `weather.py` file. When you are finished, push your changes, keep the repo private, and send us:

1. The GitHub URL. Share the repository with mcxemic@gmail.com
2. Loom with:
   1. Happy path: printing a temperature for a given city
   2. The proper error message in case of an error
   3. A short explanation of one design decision you are proud of

## Requirements

1. The script should accept exactly one positional argument - the city name.
2. The script should fetch the current temperature for the given city.
3. In case of an error, the script should exit with a proper error message.
4. All supplied tests **must pass**. If a test is wrong, fix it. not your logic üòâ
5. Update README.md with tools you used to complete the assignment:

| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| PyTest documentation | Checked how to run tests locally                |
| ChatGPT              | Copy pasted the whole block without any changes |

Good luck & have fun!
